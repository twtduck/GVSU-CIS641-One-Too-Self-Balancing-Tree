# One Too (Self Balancing) Tree

The "One Too (Self Balancing) Tree" calendar app is to help make organizing a personal calendar just a little easier. Users can put items into lists (referred to as "backlogs") and then later assign time requirements and a time for it. The app will then sync the event to a connected Google calendar instance.
